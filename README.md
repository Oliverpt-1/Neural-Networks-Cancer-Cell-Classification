# Cancer Cell Classification

A partner and I set out to build two implementations of Neural Networks for cell classification as cancerous or non-cancerous. We used Jax and PyTorch for our implementations.


Folder structure:
 - `doc/` Project instructions and other relevant documentation
 - `data/` Raw data
 - `src/` Source code for data explorations and neural network implementations
 - Paper_Neural_Networks_With_Robert_And_Oliver - Academic paper discussing our methods and overall results
